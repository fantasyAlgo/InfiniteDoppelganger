### A demo of a UDP-based multiplayer MMO, made with python3 and raylib
### -- By default the client uses the localhost IP (127.0.0.1), if you want to use someone's server, you need to specify it (in the client/network.py file). --
## How to host locally
1. pip install -r requirements.txt (use this also for running the client)
2. Go to the **server** directory
3. python3 main.py, it should automatically map your IP address server side.
4. In the main.py of the client, you need to specify your IP.
#### If you want to play with people with a different connection, you need to stop your router to block outsider connctions
## Features
- This is a demo, so **do not take this game seriously**.
- The objective of the game is to defeat the final boss.
- You have a sort of 'slide' activated with right mouse click
- There are three types of weapons, Bow, Boomerang and the simple sword.
- Dunno, have fun!
## By the way
- I used [this](https://game-endeavor.itch.io/mystic-woods) assets for the player, slime, and the skeleton.
- [This](https://snowhex.itch.io/dungeon-gathering) wonderfull asset pack was used for the dungeon
- Thanks for the friend of mine who game me his photo for the final boss
- The rest of the images are AI-generated (i agree that this is kind of unethical, but i've got no money): bow, boomerang, vomit, arrows
